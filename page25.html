Consultant also agrees to use Consultant’s best efforts to complete Mentor Services for each Project within the time suggested for each such Project or Online Course component and as set forth in any service levels or guidelines. To the extent that Consultant fails to initiate or complete Mentor Services for a particular Project within the time speciﬁed by Company for that Project, Company reserves the right to assign the Project to another Consultant and, in such an event, Consultant shall receive no fees for that Project. </li><li>Delivery. Consultants will deliver the deliverables, designs, modules, software, products, documentation and other materials speciﬁed for Mentor Services (individually or collectively, "Deliverables") in accordance with the delivery schedule and other terms and conditions set forth by Company from time to time. </li><li>Publicity Release.

Subject at all times to Sections 1 and 2 and any applicable service level requirements or guidelines for a particular Project that are set forth by Company at the time that Project is offered to Consultant, shall receive the fees stated for such Project review offer in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement. Consultant shall not be entitled to, and Company shall not be liable for, any other fees, expenses, or costs. The Company reserves the right to adjust fees at its discretion. Pricing of the fees will be dynamic, which means that fees will be ﬂexible among Projects based upon current market demands. Market demands may include, but are not limited to, Student volume resulting in variable Project demand, current supply of Mentors for Projects requiring special expertise, surge or time-sensitive pricing in order to accommodate high demand increases at peak-times. The dynamic pricing fee model means that fees for Projects will regularly change as a result of changing market demands. By accepting the Project, you are agreeing to the fees relating to the Project that are posted at the time of acceptance and to not make a claim relating to the adequacy of the fee pricing or your compensation at a later time. </li><li>Payment Terms. All fees and other amounts payable to Consultant under this Agreement, if any, are stated in and are payable in U.S. dollars and Consultant shall be responsible for the costs associated with any exchange rate converting the USD into Consultant’s local currency. Unless otherwise speciﬁed by CompassLZ.com in writing, Consultant will be paid by Company on a monthly basis for all fees payable to Consultant through the third-party payment processor of Company’s choosing. Presently, Company utilizes third party payment processing services from PayPal and/or Payoneer, but reserves the right to add or otherwise use a different payment processing service in the future. All payments made to Consultant by Company hereunder will be made through such a payment processor and are subject to and exclusive of any fees or other charges that such payment processor may charge either Company or Consultant. To the extent that Consultant resides in or is otherwise situated in a location which is not served by Company’s third-party payment process, Consultant shall not provide Mentor Services hereunder and Company shall have no obligations to Consultant hereunder. Consultant acknowledges and agrees that it is Consultant's sole and exclusive responsibility to establish an account with the third-party payment processor and to maintain such account in good standing. Consultant also agrees that the location associated with his or her payment processing account shall be accurate and consistent with Consultant’s application information. Company shall have no liability to Consultant for any payments due under this Agreement that are denied by payment processor, that remain unclaimed for a period of thirty (30) or more days, or otherwise are rejected by PayPal, Payoneer, or other Company provided third-party payment processing service for any reason. </li></ol></div></div></div></section>

Consultant agrees that any dispute between Consultant and Company arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Mentor Services, or any other Company Services (collectively, "Disputes") will be governed by the arbitration procedure outlined below.</p><ol>
                    <li>Governing Law: The resolution of any Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Pennsylvania without regard to its conﬂict of laws principles. </li><li>Informal Dispute Resolution: Company and Consultant agree that they prefer to try to resolved any concerns and/or Disputes without needing a formal legal case. Before ﬁling a claim against Company, Consultant agrees to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@CompassLZ.com">support@CompassLZ.com</a>. We'll try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you through email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission, you or Company may bring a formal proceeding. </li><li>We Both Agree to Arbitrate: Consultant and Company agree to resolve any Disputes through ﬁnal and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. </li><li>Arbitration Procedures: The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where Consultant lives or works, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, or any other location Company agrees to. </li><li>Arbitration Fees: The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Company will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $10,000. </li><li>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate: Either Consultant or Company may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Allegheny County Pennsylvania or any United States county where Consultant lives or works. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Company Services, or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright or patent rights) without ﬁrst engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute- resolution process described above. </li><li>No Class Actions: Consultant may only resolve Disputes with Company on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed under this Agreement. </li><li>Judicial Forum for Disputes: In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to Consultant or Consultant’s claim, Consultant and Company agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Both Consultant and Company consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. Company and Consultant each agree to waive our right to a jury trial. </li><li>Limitation on Claims: Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to Consultant’s use of the Company mentor marketplace, and/or Company Services, must be ﬁled within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever. </li></ol></div></div></div></section>
