Fees paid for such programs are thereafter non-refundable for that Term, even if the User selected to pay for the term in installments. For a multi-term CompassLZ.com program, you may subject to enrollment obligations for additional terms. To the extent you choose to enroll in further terms for a CompassLZ.com program, the same seven (7) day disenrollment option shall apply to each term. Please note that, for multi-term CompassLZ.com programs, if you do not complete all terms, you may not eligible to receive a credential of completion if you do not complete and pay for the CompassLZ.com. Please reviews the specific terms of each CompassLZ.com program for any such requirements. After the seven (7) days, you are still able to disenroll at any time by going to your account settings, however, you will lose access to certain Services and features, such as Mentor services, and shall not receive a refund.</p><p>Subscription Based Payments: BY SELECTING A SUBSCRIPTION BASED ENROLLMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZE COMPASLZ.COM TO AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE THE APPLICABLE RECURRING MONTHLY FEE AND ANY AND ALL APPLICABLE TAXES TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU DISENROLL, ARE REMOVED, OR GRADUATE. For any Services or products that are provided on a subscription basis, unless otherwise specified upon enrollment, your Payment Method will be authorized for up to approximately one month service charges once your Online Course begins. In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization however, no charges will be made against the Payment Method unless you do not disenroll prior to the end of the seven (7) day disenrollment period. You may not receive a notice from us that your seven (7) day disenrollment period has ended or that the subscription-based payments have begun. Your subscription will continue on a month-to-month basis with recurring payments unless and until you disenroll, are removed, or graduate. You agree to pay the then current applicable monthly payment.</p><p>Each month, the monthly fee will automatically be billed on the date your seven (7) day disenrollment period ends (“Billing Date”) For example, if you begin a paid subscription on January 1st, the seven (7) day disenrollment period will end on January 7th, you will be charged on January 8th for the first month and your Billing Date will be the 8th of each subsequent month until you disenroll or are removed from the Online Course or graduate. For certain months, your Billing Date may vary slightly if your Billing Date does not have a corresponding date the next month – for example if the first charge was made on January 31st you will be billed on February 28th. Failure to pay may result in the termination of your subscription.</p><p>Currently, your subscription to CompassLZ.com products or Services may start with a free trial. The length of the free trial period for any of your subscriptions will last for the period of time specified during your sign-up. Free trials for any products or services may not be combined with certain other offers when specified in the offer language. If you have subscribed to a particular paid service or product within the last six (6) months, or if your Payment Method, physical address or email address has been associated with an account for that paid service, you are not eligible to receive a free trial for that service or product. If you begin your subscription with a free trial, we will begin billing your Payment Method for monthly membership fees at the end of the free trial period of your subscription unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period by contacting&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@CompassLZ.com">support@CompassLZ.com</a>. Your Payment Method will be authorized for up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register for a free trial. In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization; however, no charges will be made against the Payment Method unless if you cancel prior to the end of your free trial period.</p><p>Your subscription will continue unless and until you graduate, terminate your subscription, or we terminate it. You may terminate your subscription by contacting us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@CompassLZ.com">support@CompassLZ.com</a>&nbsp;and requesting to be disenrolled in a particular Online Course or by going to your account settings and disenrolling from the Online Course. You must disenroll from an Online Course last day of your previous billing period in order to avoid being billed for the next period’s monthly fee. If you choose to disenroll from an Online Course, you may use the Online Course until the end of the current period but will not be issued a refund for the most recently (or previously) charged monthly fees. At the end of the then-current period, you will lose access to certain Services and features.</p><p>When you graduate from an Online Course before your next Billing Date, you will not be billed for the next period’s monthly fee. After graduation, you will lose access to certain Services and features as further set forth in the applicable CompassLZ.com program FAQs and/or details.</p><p>If you cancel your subscription at any time before the Online Course begins, you will not be charged, but you may be ineligible for certain promotions and pricing in the future. For example, you cannot be awarded a Verified Certificate or similar certification during your free trial period because you must pay for at least one (1) month of an Online Course subscription to be eligible for a Verified Certificate in that Online Course in addition to the completion requirements set forth above. In the case of CompassLZ.com program, you must pay for no less than one (1) month of Online Courses and meet all of the other then current requirements to obtain promotional pricing, rebates or discounts.</p><p>We reserve the right to modify, terminate, or otherwise amend the fees and features associated with your subscription. If we notify you in advance of at least fifteen (15) days, your continued use of CompassLZ.com and the Online Course after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not wish to continue subscribing with the new fees or features, you may terminate your subscription by disenrolling. If you accept the new subscription, its terms and conditions with these Terms will apply for all future months.</p><p>Refunds: Other than stated above for each form of enrollment, you hereby acknowledge and agree that CompassLZ.com will not offer refunds on any fees and charges related to your purchase of any products or Services. This includes any partially used or unused periods for which you have already paid. We do not guarantee refunds for lack of usage or dissatisfaction. For subscription-based enrollments, upon the termination of your subscription—whether by disenrollment or graduation—you will not be charged for future monthly fees. However, you will not be issued a refund for the most recently (or any previously) charged fees. If you purchase any Online Course or Service through a mobile purchase or third-party marketplace (e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store, Android App Store or purchases made through certain alternative payment services), the refund policy applicable to that third-party marketplace will apply, unless otherwise explicitly stated by CompassLZ.com. Except as otherwise explicitly stated by CompassLZ.com, the third-party marketplace will be solely responsible for making refunds under its refund policy, and CompassLZ.com will have no refund obligations. CompassLZ.com disclaims any responsibility or liability related to any third-party marketplace's refund policy or the third party's compliance or noncompliance with such policy.</p><p>Taxes: When you purchase any Online Course or other Service or product from CompassLZ.com, you agree to pay not only the applicable fee, but also all applicable sales, use, value added, transaction taxes, or other government-required fees and charges that CompassLZ.com determines it is required to collect (“Taxes”).

You hereby agree to indemnify and hold CompassLZ.com harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for any underpayment of any Taxes, including, without limitation, VAT, and any related penalties and/or interest.</p><p>Credit Card Billing: Credit card payments are processed by our third-party payment processor(s), including as Stripe and/or PayPal. By agreeing to this Terms of Use, you agree to be bound by Stripe’s Terms of Service or PayPal’s Terms of Service as applicable. Any breach of those terms will be treated as a breach of these Terms. If you have selected a subscription-based enrollment or implemented an installment plan, you will be automatically charge your credit card monthly for the cost of the Online Course and any applicable taxes. If you have selected a subscription-based enrollment or implemented an installment plan, you will be automatically charged to the Payment Method for the cost of the Online Course and any applicable taxes. If any fee is not paid in a timely manner, or our processors are unable to process your transaction using the credit card information provided, we reserve the right to terminate your account or suspend or terminate your access to the Online Course as we deem appropriate. If your payment details change, your card provider may provide us with updated card details and you agree to our collection of such details. We may use these new details in order to help prevent any interruption to the Services.
